trojan to control a remote machine

This project has two parts: server and client side. The firts one is which we have to install into the victim machine. With the second one we can control the victim machine. To do that its necessary to know the victim machine ip. It can be known because the trojan, when its installed into victims machine, make a request to an URL which records victim Ip.
